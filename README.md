This repository demonstrates a common Swift coding error: forgetting to provide all required arguments when calling a function.  The `bug.swift` file shows the error, while `bugSolution.swift` provides the corrected code. This is a crucial error to understand for Swift beginners as it directly relates to function calls and parameter handling. The compiler error message is clear and helps identify the issue.  The solution focuses on ensuring all function parameters are explicitly passed.
